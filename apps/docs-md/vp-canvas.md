## Prioritization Lens

### Four Filters Before Committing Dev

Not a ranking -- a decision framework. Every idea above should pass through all four before it gets a sprint.

#### Filter 01: Operator Pull

Would Marcus (Tier-1), Sofia (mid-market), or Daniel (aggregator) pay more for this? If no persona cares, shelve it.

#### Filter 02: Viral Coefficient

Does this feature generate shares, invites, or content? Every feature should retain or distribute. If neither, it's a nice-to-have.

#### Filter 03: Regulatory Surface

Can it ship under Curacao today? GLI-certified for MGA within 6 months? Novel regulatory = separate longer track.

#### Filter 04: Defensibility

How long until Spribe copies this? Simple UI: 3 months. Social infra (Crews, cross-operator identity): 12-18 months. Prioritize what compounds.
