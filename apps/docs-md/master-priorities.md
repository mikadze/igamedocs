## Priority Logic

Every feature was scored across four filters: **Operator Pull** (would Marcus/Sofia/Daniel/Kai pay for this?), **Viral Coefficient** (does it generate shares, invites, or content?), **Regulatory Surface** (can it ship under Curacao today, GLI within 6 months?), and **Defensibility** (how long until Spribe copies it?). P0 features score high on all four. P4 features score very high on defensibility but face effort/regulatory barriers. The sweet spot for immediate impact is the P0 + P1 features marked as Low or Med effort.
