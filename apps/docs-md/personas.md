## 01 -- Tier-1 Operator

### Marcus Lindqvist

**Head of Casino, Tier-1 Licensed Operator**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Company size | 500-2,000 staff |
| Licenses | MGA, UKGC, Ontario |
| Monthly GGR | EUR 30M-EUR 120M |
| Crash share of GGR | ~4% (wants 10%+) |
| Primary KPI | Player LTV & NGR margin |
| Decision speed | Slow (6-12 wk review) |

> "Crash is our fastest-growing category but every provider gives me the same game in a different skin. I can't differentiate on crash -- my competitors have the same Spribe/Turbo games I do."

Marcus manages a portfolio of 4,000+ slots and 80+ live tables. Crash games are high-margin and attract a younger demo he's struggling to retain, but current crash offerings are interchangeable. He needs something that makes players choose *his* platform for crash specifically, not just whoever has the best deposit bonus.

### Pains

- **Zero differentiation in crash** [Severity: 5/5]
  Every operator has the same 3-4 crash games. No exclusivity, no moat. Players switch for better bonuses.

- **Crash players churn fast** [Severity: 5/5]
  No persistent identity or progression in crash -- sessions are isolated. Average crash player lifetime is 2-3 months vs. 8+ for slots.

- **Regulatory risk on novel mechanics** [Severity: 4/5]
  UKGC & MGA scrutiny on social features -- needs any new mechanic pre-certified and compliant with responsible gambling.

- **Can't attract Gen-Z organically** [Severity: 4/5]
  Brand is built for 30+ slots players. Crash is his best Gen-Z hook but current UX feels dated to that demo.

- **Integration complexity budget** [Severity: 3/5]
  Devs are overloaded with sportsbook migration. New game integrations need to be API-standard and low-effort.

### Gains

- **Exclusive social crash product** [Impact: 5/5]
  A crash experience competitors can't replicate -- Crews, Squads, Survivor Lobbies as platform-exclusive features.

- **2-3x crash player LTV** [Impact: 5/5]
  Social bonds (Squads, Crews) and progression (Flight Records) create switching costs that extend player lifetime.

- **Organic acquisition via share loops** [Impact: 4/5]
  Black Box shares and Crew invite links bring new players at near-zero CAC -- branded to his platform.

- **Young demo credibility** [Impact: 4/5]
  TikTok-native sharing, streamer lobbies, and tournament formats signal "this casino gets Gen-Z."

- **Pre-certified compliance** [Impact: 3/5]
  Social mechanics arrive GLI-certified -- no extra compliance overhead for his legal team.

### Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Grow crash from 4% to 10%+ of GGR**
  Needs a crash product compelling enough to drive habitual play, not just trial sessions.

- **Reduce CPA for 18-28 segment**
  Current CPA for young players is EUR 80-EUR 120. Needs a viral channel that undercuts paid acquisition.

- **Increase sessions per player per week**
  Crash players average 2.1 sessions/wk. Wants 4+ via scheduled tournaments and Squad play.

- **Justify crash investment to board**
  Needs clear ROI narrative: social crash -> higher LTV, lower CAC, younger demo, category exclusivity.

- **Launch fast with minimal dev lift**
  Integration must work via standard GCI/RGS API. No custom backend work from his team.

### How Aviatrix Answers This Persona

- **Differentiation Play:** Exclusive Squad & Survivor Lobby configs per operator -- his players build social identity on *his* platform, creating lock-in competitors can't match.
- **LTV Extension:** Squad Communal Shield + Crew Flight Records create switching costs. Leaving means abandoning your group's streak, status, and safety net.
- **Acquisition Engine:** Operator-branded Black Box cards & Crash Clips carry his logo. Every share is a free branded ad with a deep-link back to his platform.
- **Integration Path:** Standard RGS/GCI API, pre-certified by GLI for MGA & UKGC. Plug-and-play -- no custom backend. Social layer runs on Aviatrix infra.

## 02 -- Mid-Market Operator

### Sofia Petrova

**CEO, Mid-Market Online Casino**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Company size | 40-120 staff |
| Licenses | Curacao (MGA pending) |
| Monthly GGR | EUR 1M-EUR 8M |
| Markets | LatAm, Africa, CIS |
| Primary KPI | Player volume & CPA |
| Decision speed | Fast (1-3 weeks) |

> "I'm spending EUR 60 per depositing player on Facebook ads and they play for two weeks and leave. I need games that bring players to me, not games I have to push players toward."

Sofia runs a lean operation competing against well-funded Tier-1s in high-growth emerging markets. Her advantage is speed and willingness to try new products. Her biggest constraint is marketing budget -- she can't outspend competitors on paid acquisition. She needs products that generate their own traffic.

### Pains

- **Unsustainable CPA economics** [Severity: 5/5]
  Paid acquisition costs rising 20% YoY. Can't compete with Tier-1 ad spend on Google/Meta in her markets.

- **No organic growth flywheel** [Severity: 5/5]
  Current game portfolio generates zero word-of-mouth. Every player costs money to acquire individually.

- **Streamer deals too expensive** [Severity: 4/5]
  Top crash streamers demand EUR 15K-EUR 50K/month guarantees. ROI is hard to measure and inconsistent.

- **Same game catalog as everyone** [Severity: 4/5]
  Her aggregator gives her the same Spribe, Turbo, SmartSoft games every competitor has. Zero moat.

- **WhatsApp/Telegram-heavy markets** [Severity: 3/5]
  Her players live on messaging apps. No current game mechanic leverages this as a distribution channel.

### Gains

- **Self-distributing game product** [Impact: 5/5]
  Crew invite links on WhatsApp = free player acquisition through the exact channel her players already use.

- **CPA drops to near-zero at scale** [Impact: 5/5]
  Each active player recruits 1-3 friends via Crew invites. Viral coefficient >1 means organic growth compounds.

- **Affordable streamer activation** [Impact: 4/5]
  Pilot's Seat gives mid-tier streamers a reason to play on her platform -- the feature is the draw, not the guarantee.

- **LatAm & Africa-native virality** [Impact: 4/5]
  Black Box cards on WhatsApp Status + QR deep-links are built for how her markets actually share content.

- **Compete above weight class** [Impact: 3/5]
  Social crash features make her platform feel premium & innovative vs. competitors with bigger budgets.

### Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Get CPA under EUR 20**
  Needs organic/viral channels that cut paid acquisition dependency by 60%+.

- **Build a retention moat**
  Players need a reason to stay that isn't just deposit bonuses -- social identity & crew investment.

- **Win in WhatsApp-first markets**
  Needs game mechanics designed for messaging-app sharing, not desktop browser play.

- **Attract streamers without big guarantees**
  Needs features so compelling that mid-tier streamers want to play for the content, not just the paycheck.

- **Scale to MGA with proof of traction**
  Needs strong revenue metrics from Curacao to fund MGA licensing and enter regulated EU markets.

### How Aviatrix Answers This Persona

- **Viral Growth Engine:** Crew invite links + Black Box QR codes on WhatsApp Status turn every active player into a recruiter. Designed for LatAm & Africa messaging habits.
- **Streamer Economics:** Pilot's Seat is compelling content -- mid-tier streamers will play for the feature, not the guarantee. She pays performance-based, not fixed.
- **Retention Mechanics:** Crews and Squads create social debt. Players who recruit friends into their Crew don't churn -- they've built something on her platform.
- **Speed to Market:** Fast integration via aggregator or direct RGS. First Survivor Lobby tournament can run within 2 weeks of going live.

## 03 -- Game Aggregator

### Daniel Obeng

**VP Product, Game Aggregator / Platform**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Company size | 80-300 staff |
| Operator clients | 200-600 casinos |
| Games in portfolio | 8,000-15,000 |
| Crash games live | 12-20 titles |
| Primary KPI | Operator adoption & GGR share |
| Decision speed | Medium (4-6 weeks) |

> "I have 15 crash games in my portfolio and operators only activate 3. They all look the same. I need something that makes operators *request* integration instead of me pushing it."

Daniel curates the game catalog that 400+ operators access through a single API. His business model is a revenue share on GGR flowing through his platform. He needs games that operators actively want and that generate outsized GGR compared to the integration effort. Crash is a growing category, but current titles are commoditized.

### Pains

- **Crash titles are commoditized** [Severity: 5/5]
  All crash games feel identical -- same curve, same bet/cashout UX. Operators see no reason to activate a 16th crash game.

- **Low operator activation rate** [Severity: 5/5]
  Onboards a new crash game -> only 15-20% of operators bother activating it. Rest ignore the email.

- **No cross-operator network effects** [Severity: 4/5]
  Each operator runs crash games in isolation. No shared liquidity, no cross-platform tournaments, no aggregator-level value-add.

- **Margin pressure from providers** [Severity: 3/5]
  Top crash providers demand lower aggregator share because their games are "must-have." Bargaining power is shifting.

### Gains

- **Category-defining crash title** [Impact: 5/5]
  A crash game so differentiated that operators request it by name -- drives inbound demand instead of outbound sales.

- **Cross-operator tournament network** [Impact: 5/5]
  Survivor Lobbies with shared player pools across operators create network effects that make his aggregator indispensable.

- **Higher GGR per integration** [Impact: 4/5]
  Social mechanics drive 3-5x session frequency. More play = more GGR = more aggregator revenue per operator.

- **Content marketing powered by players** [Impact: 3/5]
  "Best Black Box of the Week" across all operators = aggregator-branded content engine showcasing his network.

### Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Get 60%+ operator activation on new crash title**
  Needs a game compelling enough that operators self-activate without sales follow-up.

- **Build aggregator-level network effects**
  Cross-operator tournaments and shared leaderboards make his platform more valuable than any single game.

- **Increase wallet share from crash category**
  Crash is 6% of his total GGR. Social crash could push it to 12-15% with the right product.

- **Differentiate from competing aggregators**
  Exclusive or early access to social crash gives him a reason operators choose his platform over alternatives.

### How Aviatrix Answers This Persona

- **Operator Pull:** Survivor Lobbies and Crew mechanics are so visually different from existing crash that operators request activation proactively after seeing one demo.
- **Network Effect Layer:** Cross-operator Survivor tournaments pool players across his network -- more operators = bigger lobbies = better experience = more operators want in.
- **Aggregator Branding:** Weekly "Best Black Box" showcase features rounds from across his operator network -- positions his platform as the home of social crash.
- **Commercial Upside:** Higher GGR per operator means higher aggregator rev-share. Social crash can become his highest-yielding category per integration slot.

## 04 -- Crypto Casino

### Kai Nakamura

**Founder, Crypto-Native Casino**

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Company size | 10-40 staff |
| Licenses | Curacao / unlicensed |
| Monthly volume | $2M-$30M wagered |
| Markets | Global, crypto-first |
| Primary KPI | Wager volume & virality |
| Decision speed | Instant (1-5 days) |

> "My players care about three things: provably fair, degen energy, and flex. Give me a game that lets them show off and compete with their Discord crew."

Kai runs a fast-moving crypto casino that competes on culture and speed, not regulation. His players are crypto-native, risk-tolerant, and community-driven. They live on Discord and Twitter/X. He needs products that generate organic content and feed his community's competitive energy.

### Pains

- **Crash is already "basic" to his users** [Severity: 5/5]
  Crypto players have been playing crash since Bustabit (2014). Standard crash is stale. They want the next evolution.

- **Community content is manual** [Severity: 4/5]
  Players screenshot wins and post to Discord/X manually. No automated content pipeline despite massive community sharing culture.

- **No competitive structure** [Severity: 4/5]
  Discord community has strong competitive energy but crash has no native PvP format. Running manual tournaments is a pain.

- **Retention without bonuses** [Severity: 3/5]
  Rakeback and deposit bonuses eat margin. Needs intrinsic retention mechanics, not just financial incentives.

### Gains

- **"Next-gen crash" narrative** [Impact: 5/5]
  Being first to offer social crash = major clout. His CT audience will amplify the launch as "the future of crash."

- **Automated content engine** [Impact: 5/5]
  Black Box + Crash Clips auto-generate shareable assets. His Discord becomes a 24/7 content feed with zero effort.

- **Survivor Lobbies as events** [Impact: 4/5]
  Hourly tournaments give his Discord community scheduled events -- "everyone in the 9pm Survivor" becomes culture.

- **Crew leaderboards as flex** [Impact: 4/5]
  Flight Records and crew rankings give degens something to screenshot and flex on X. Status > money for this demo.

### Jobs-to-be-Done

- **Re-energize crash category**
  Needs a crash product that feels genuinely new to players who've been playing since Bustabit.

- **Turn Discord into a growth engine**
  Auto-generated content (clips, replays) that Discord members share externally, bringing in new users.

- **Run tournaments without ops overhead**
  Currently runs manual tourneys via Google Sheets. Needs native tournament infra with auto prize distribution.

- **Ship fast, iterate faster**
  Wants to be live in days, not months. Will test features with community and feed back requests immediately.

### How Aviatrix Answers This Persona

- **Culture Fit:** Crew competition, Flight Record flex, and Survivor Lobbies match crypto-native culture perfectly -- competitive, status-driven, community-first.
- **Content Automation:** Crash Clips + Black Box auto-post to Discord channels. His community generates its own marketing 24/7 without mod effort.
- **Zero-Ops Tournaments:** Survivor Lobbies run on a schedule with automated brackets, prize distribution, and leaderboard updates. No Google Sheets needed.
- **Integration Speed:** Lightweight API, crypto-native payment rails already supported. Can go live in under a week with full feature set.
