## Strategic Positioning

### Where Aviatrix Plays -- And Where No One Else Does

Two axes that matter most to B2B buyers: how social/multiplayer the experience is (x-axis), and how much built-in viral distribution the game generates (y-axis). The upper-right quadrant is empty today -- that's the opportunity.

**Axes:**

- **X-axis:** Social Depth (Solitary -> Multiplayer)
- **Y-axis:** Viral Distribution Infrastructure (No sharing -> Self-distributing)

**Quadrants:**

| | Low Social | High Social |
|---|---|---|
| **High Viral** | Basic game + social sharing | Social + viral -- THE PRIZE |
| **Low Viral** | Commodity crash | Social play, no distribution |

## Strategic Takeaways

### Three Insights for the Sales Deck

#### Insight 01: The entire market clusters in one quadrant

Every crash provider -- Spribe, SmartSoft, Pragmatic, Turbo -- occupies the same position: solitary gameplay, no viral tools. They compete on visuals and house edge. That's a feature war with no moat. Aviatrix competes on a different axis entirely.

#### Insight 02: 11 unique capabilities, zero overlap

In the feature matrix, Aviatrix has 11 capabilities marked "UNIQUE" -- Crews, Copy-Bet, Black Box, Crash Clips, etc. No competitor has even one of these. This isn't incremental improvement; it's a category expansion from "crash game" to "social crash platform."

#### Insight 03: Distribution is the real product

Every competitor sells a game. Aviatrix sells an acquisition engine. The operator doesn't just get a new game -- they get Crew invite links, branded Black Box shares, and Crash Clips that turn every player into a recruiter. That's the pitch that lands with Sofia (mid-market) and Daniel (aggregator).
