- **GLI / eCOGRA** -- certification bodies for provably fair + social mechanics
- **Social platforms** -- TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp deep-link partnerships
- **Payment processors** -- crypto + fiat rails for global reach

## Value Propositions

- **Built-In Distribution Engine** -- Every round generates shareable artifacts (Black Box, Crash Clips) -- players become marketers via one-tap share to TikTok/Stories
- **Decision Anxiety Solved** -- Copy-Bet & Follow Pilot lower the barrier for new players -- watch a trusted streamer, mirror their exit
- **Persistent Identity & Status** -- Flight Records, Squad Hangars, leaderboards, and crew streaks give players something to build -- not just bet
- **Spectator-Ready Formats** -- Survivor Lobbies (100 to 1 elimination) turn crash into e-sport with narrative arcs streamers build content around

## Customer Relationships

- **Squad social bonds** -- guild-like retention via Communal Shield & shared identity **[NEW]**
- **Streamer-mediated trust** -- players follow pilots they trust, reducing churn
